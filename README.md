# Earthquake Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to create a machine learning model for predicting earthquake magnitudes using historical seismic data. By analyzing patterns and features in earthquake events, we can build a predictive model that estimates the magnitude of future earthquakes.

## Packages Used

To implement this project, we'll be using the following Python packages:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For enhancing plot aesthetics.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Dataset

Our dataset consists of earthquake events recorded by the seismic monitoring network. It includes information such as location, depth, and other relevant features associated with each earthquake.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the earthquake prediction model:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Obtain the earthquake dataset (you can use publicly available seismic data).
   - Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore the dataset to understand its distribution, correlations, and relevant features.
   - Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to gain insights.

3. **Feature Selection and Engineering**:
   - Identify important features for earthquake magnitude prediction.
   - Consider features like location, depth, time of occurrence, and historical seismic activity.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
   - Choose an appropriate regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, random forest, or gradient boosting).
   - Train the model using the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

6. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict earthquake magnitudes for new data points.
   - Visualize the predictions and compare them with actual magnitudes.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model in a production environment (e.g., as an API or web service) for real-time predictions.
